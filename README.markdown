Siter
=====

Siter is a very simple static website generator written in Python.

Content pages from `siter-pages` are fitted in `siter-template/page.html`. Pages can define variables and simple macros that the template and page can call.

Sample
------

    cd sample
    siter       # generate
    siter force # regenerate all files, even up-to-date ones
