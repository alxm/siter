Siter is a very simple static website generator written in Python.

Content pages from siter-pages are fitted in siter-template/siter-template.html.
Pages can define variables and simple macros that the template and page content
can call. The first blank line in the file signals the content's beginning.

Check out the included sample dir for a small example:

cd sample
siter       # generate
siter force # regenerate all files, even up-to-date ones
