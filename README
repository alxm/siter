Siter is a very simple static website generator written in Python.

Content pages from ~/site/siter-pages are fitted in ~/site/siter-template.html.
Pages can define variables and simple macros that the template and page content
can call. These are declared one per line, with a blank line before the page's
content begins.

Check out the included sample dir for a small example: ./siter.py sample
