Siter is a very simple static website generator written in Python.

Content pages from site/siter-pages are fitted in site/siter-template.html.
Pages can define variables that the template can call. Variables are declared
one per line, with a blank line before the page's content begins.

Call "siter.py PathToSite" to generate a site. Check out the included sample dir
for a small example - ./siter.py sample
